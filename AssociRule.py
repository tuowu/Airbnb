This module is for Association Rules / Frequent Itemset Mining Analysis
    - Use Python3 to code and run association rule mining on a subset of your data. Use at least 3 different support levels. 
      Use the Apriori algorithm. Recall that the support (sup) and the confidence (conf) can be calculated. What patterns are most frequent? 
      Is this surprising? Explain your findings.
