This module is for Predictive Analysis - Hypothesis Testing
    - This component contains both the traditional statistical hypothesis testing, and the beginning of machine learning predictive analytics. 
      Here you will write three (3) hypotheses and see whether or not they are supported by your data. You must use all of the methods listed below 
      (at least once) on your data.
    - You do not need to try all the methods for each hypothesis. For example, you might use ANOVA for one of your hypotheses, and you might use a 
      t-test and linear regression for another, etc. It will be the case, that some of the hypotheses will not be well supported.
    - When trying methods like a decision tree, you should use cross-validation and show your ROC curve and a confusion matrix. For each method, 
      explain the method in one paragraph.
    - Explain how and why you will apply your selected method(s) to each hypothesis, and discuss the results.
    - Therefore, you will have at least three (3) hypothesis tests and will apply all seven (7) of the following methods to one or more of your 
      hypotheses.
    - Required methods:
        - t-test or Anova  (choose one)
        - Linear Regression or Logistical Regression  (multivariate or multinomial) (choose one)
        - Decision tree
        - A Lazy Learner Method (such as kNN)
        - Na√Øve Bayes
        - SVM
        - Random Forest
