This module is for cluster analysis
    - Conduct three (3) cluster analyses on your data. Include a hierarchical clustering method (such as Ward), a partition clustering method 
      (use k-means), and third, use the dbscan clustering analysis on your data. Explain your findings.
    - Use the Silhouette coefficient to assess the quality of the clusters.  Ref: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html
    - Plot the clusters or if the dimensionality is too high, plot a PCA projection of the clusters. 
      Does the plot give you additional insight about the clustering â€“ explain.
